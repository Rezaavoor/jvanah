        "As Hena, a proud resident of Sweden and a dedicated student of textile design, our roots trace back to the beautiful land of Afghanistan, a place filled with resilience and hope. Having experienced the profound impact of education firsthand, we are acutely aware of the struggles endured by women and girls in Afghanistan, unable to pursue their educational dreams. Driven by a deep sense of purpose, we have embarked on a personal mission to make a difference through Jvanah, an online education program specifically tailored for Afghan women. With Jvanah, we are determined to break down barriers and provide these women with the tools they need to continue their education, despite the challenges they face.",

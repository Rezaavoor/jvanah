We are honored to share the highlights from our recent lecture organized by the **Jvanah Organization** in collaboration with **Hägerstensåsens medborgarhus**. On **January 15, 2025**, we gathered at the library in Hägerstensåsens medborgarhus to discuss the history and current challenges faced by women in Afghanistan.

### Understanding Women’s Struggles in Afghanistan

The lecture provided a comprehensive historical overview of Afghan women’s rights, from the early 20th century to today’s challenges under Taliban rule. Our speakers detailed how each political era shaped the freedoms and limitations imposed on women.

### A Journey Through History

The event covered key historical milestones, including:

- **Early reforms (1919–1980s):** Amanullah Khan’s government introduced the first modern women’s rights reforms, including voting rights and educational opportunities. However, conservative opposition forced him into exile. Later, leaders like Mohammad Zahir Shah and Daud Khan attempted to reinstate women’s rights by opening schools and appointing women to governmental positions.

- **Soviet Era (1979–1989):** The Soviet-backed government introduced mandatory education for girls and established laws against child marriage. However, following the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan plunged into civil war, with conservative Mujahideen forces restricting women’s rights once again.

- **Taliban Rule (1996–2001):** Under Taliban control, women were stripped of fundamental rights, including education and employment. Strict dress codes, mobility restrictions, and social segregation were enforced through violence and repression.

- **Post-2001 Progress and Challenges:** The fall of the Taliban brought new hope, with advancements in women’s education, workforce participation, and legal protections such as the EVAW (Elimination of Violence Against Women) law. However, progress was uneven, particularly in rural areas.

- **The Return of the Taliban (2021–Present):** With the Taliban regaining power, women once again face severe restrictions. Girls are banned from secondary and higher education, women are excluded from most workplaces, and strict mobility laws are enforced. Many activists continue to resist, despite facing threats and violence.

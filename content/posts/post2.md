We are incredibly proud and honored to announce that the **Jvanah Initiative** has been awarded the 2024 Human Rights Diploma by the Stockholm UN Association. This prestigious recognition was presented to us during the annual Human Rights Day celebration on **December 10th, 2024**.

### A Night to Remember

The event, held at Bysistorget 8 in Stockholm, was a memorable evening dedicated to celebrating the champions of human rights. The night began with an insightful lecture by Jens Petersson, the Secretary-General of the UN Association, who spoke about the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the challenges it faces.

Following the lecture, the highlight of the evening was the presentation of the Human Rights Diplomas. This year, the diploma for **Human Rights Champion of the Year** was awarded to Fatemeh Khavari for her relentless work in advocating for refugee rights. We are thrilled to share that the diploma for **Human Rights Organization of the Year** was awarded to Jvanah for our efforts in providing free and accessible online education to Afghan women and girls.

### Our Commitment to Human Rights

Receiving this diploma is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, volunteers, and supporters. It recognizes our commitment to empowering Afghan women through education, enabling them to overcome barriers and achieve their dreams. We are deeply grateful for this honor and motivated to continue our mission.

The evening also provided an opportunity for members and guests to network and celebrate the achievements of the diploma recipients. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who attended and made the night special, including Jens Petersson, our award recipients, and **Restaurang Legumes** for their vital contribution to the event.

The centerpiece of the event was the photo exhibition, featuring a stunning collection of photographs taken by women from our online classes. Each image told a unique story, capturing the challenges and triumphs faced by women in Afghanistan. The exhibition provided a powerful visual narrative that resonated deeply with all who attended.

Attendees spent time exploring the gallery, engaging with the stories behind each photograph. The creativity and skill displayed by our students were truly inspiring, highlighting the importance of providing educational opportunities to women in restrictive environments.
